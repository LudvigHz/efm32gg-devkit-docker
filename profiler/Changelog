==== Version 1.14 ====
[General]
 * Fixed issue with displaying wrong value of running average current 
   and running average power.

==== Version 1.13 ====
[General]
 * Added Zero Gecko support.
 * Improved SWO parser.
 * Less IRQs and PCs are lost in high speed mode.
 * Fixed issue with displaying incorrect IRQs names on the graph.

==== Version 1.12 ====
[General]
 * Demos are now sorted ascending.
 * Fixed issue with reporting power in low-speed mode.
 * High speed mode is no longer considered experimental.
 * Clarified use of LGPL licensensed libraries.
 * Fixed issue where disabling SWO output would not work.
 * New SWO data parser algorithm.
 * Improved setupSWO() function example.

==== Version 1.11 ====
[General]
 * Removed statusbar and replaced it with new view in the AEM graph.
 * Support for Wonder Gecko.
 * Demo dialog now supports demos that use the external flash.
 * Fixed the setupSWO() function for Leopard and Wonder parts.
 * Improved performance when looking up function names.
 * Fixed an issue where negative energy would be displayed in the 
   energy profile.
[Linux]
 * SWO output should now work correctly (updated the .so file)

==== Version 1.10 ====
[Demos]
 * The profiler now uses the downloaded demos from Simplicity Studio.
   Please download the BSPs for your kit before using the demo mode.
 * Using SWO in demo mode is now optional. The binaries in the BSPs
   check the first word in the userpage (address 0x0FE00000) for a
   zero. If found, it does not enable SWO output. This lowers power
   consumption.

==== Version 1.01 ====
[General]
 * Help is now online
 * Better support for Linux

==== Version 1.00 ====
[General]
 * Added experimental support for High speed AEM sampling. This
   requires a firmware upgrade.
 * Samples are now based on microseconds.

[Graph]
 * Zoom levels are now reported a 1x, 2x, etc
 * Graph when zoomed out averages samples instead of displaying all of them.

[Codeview]
 * Fixed typo in the help text (not in the setupSWO() function).

==== Version 0.995 ===
[Demos]
 * Updated demos to version 2.0.2
 * Added internal temperature demo

[Graph]
 * Added display of voltage along with current.

==== Version 0.99 ====
[Demos]
 * Added Tiny Gecko demos.
 * Demo mode now checks what kind of board you have and selects applicable
   demos.
 * Added box for selecting interrupt vector table.
 * Updated flashloader to work with tiny gecko.
 * Other minor tweaks.

==== Version 0.93 ====
[Graph]
 * Fixed some calculations for averages.


==== Version 0.91 ====
[General]
 * Added functionality for loading traces

[GUI]
 * Merge Start/Stop button
 * Added preference markers
 * Added help functionality.

 * Ability to set markers in right-click menu.
 * Use markers to measure a small region of the graph.

[Codeview]
 * Ability to set user specified syntax highlightning colors
 * Show the help text after user has clicked on the graph.

[Energy Profile]
 * Added a progress bar to show energy contribution graphically
 * Double click on a function to select a color for drawing that function
   in the graph.
